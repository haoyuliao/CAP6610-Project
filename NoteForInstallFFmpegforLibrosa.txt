There are few things you need to check:

librosa can't read mp3 files directly so it tries to use the audioread package.

Audioread tries to utilise a number of different packages that may or may not be installed. One of those is ffmpeg.

However it uses FFmpeg 'via its command-line interface'. I think this is the reason that pip installing FFmpeg doesn't work. It needs the ffmpeg.exe file.

You can download the ffmpeg installer from here

After it is installed make sure you can start ffmpeg from the command line (type ffmpeg -h). You will probably need to add the path to the install folder (eg c:\ffmpeg\bin) to the Windows path.

Finally, make sure to restart your IDE. Visual Studio Code probably won't recognise the new path until after a reset.
